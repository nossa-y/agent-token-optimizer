# Roadmap

## Initial Public Release

- Local-clone build and install workflow
- Deterministic Codex and Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hooks
- Install, dry-run, doctor, repeat install, uninstall, and rollback behavior
- Bounded local discovery, ranking, redaction, and owner-only cache persistence
- Secured non-default MCP surface
- Cross-platform lifecycle CI, dependency audit, SBOM, and public-readiness checks
- Honest experimental positioning with no unsupported token-savings claim

## Evidence Gate

Before publishing a savings claim, rerun paired provider scenarios with 100% required hook
activation and behavioral success. The optimized arm must lower aggregate cost and paired
median total tokens, keep every context pack within budget, and avoid unapproved scenario
regressions. Failed or missing optimized cases cannot be excluded from the headline
result.

## Later Candidates

- A smaller distribution mechanism, only if it preserves inspectability and local trust
- Additional hosts with a verified deterministic pre-prompt integration
- More compact structural analysis and context formats
- A reduced or retired MCP surface based on measured schema overhead and user need
- Cache inspection and selective workspace eviction
- Reproducible release artifacts after the local-clone product has proven demand

Roadmap items are proposals, not commitments. Security and measured user value take
priority over host count or packaging breadth.
